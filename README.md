# Graduation-Project-DOTNET-API Attempt

I was in an internship with doctor gt startup company, even though i had worked before on the dotnet core framework it was not as immersive, wide and vast as my experience with doctorgt.

Even though my experience was great, it still was my first time landing my feet on a real world application building approaches, thus this attempt was full of mistakes, but i might one day
consider to have some fun and go back to check this project.

The course i took --> https://www.udemy.com/share/103bzr3@zlLl55X7izLSM1JjsFEhMkR0_Raq90VbL7yo4iBUx4hkebzZ2ju7h8Ex5E2zil34xA==/

And by the way it was a great course!!! Highly recommended!
